# Image Analysis Data Description

## Work Range

Jiangxin He's Part: From folder "2020_01_06" to folder "2020_02_07".

## Release Notes

1. Unnecessary pixel count columns 4-12 are removed.

2. Horizon/Vertical column is now added. H stands for Horizon and V stands for Vertical.

3. Date of Image column: data is now printed according to folders' name.

4. Pixels per unit data after folder "2021_01_16" will be calculated by Microsoft Excel through function. Only pixel count data will be manually copied to Microsoft Excel sheet.

## Error Correction

1. Pixel count raw data is directly copied & pasted from Fiji > Analyze > Set Scale… > Distance in pixels by shortcuts, thus error rate should be very low.

2. Pixels per unit data for folders before "2021_01_16" is manually copied from Fiji > Analyze > Set Scale… > Scale, typo error may exist. Thankfully this issue can be easily solved though calculated in Microsoft Excel.

3. Draw line error. Because in many image, there is no reference line, or dots thus it is difficult to draw exactly the same line. I personally recommend that next time, reference parallel lines or reference dots can be built in number tags.
